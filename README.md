# Data Science -Titanic classification

These notebooks walk us through one of the first challenges of the Kaggle platform, the legendary Titanic ML competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 

This project has been prepared for educational purposes to dive into ML workflows and familiarize students with how data science problems can basically be handled .

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

In this challenge, we have been asked to build a predictive model that answers the question:
“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
